# Ratchet-Pinegrow-Plugin
Build mobile apps with simple HTML‚ CSS‚ and JS components using Pinegrow

Getting a Ratchet prototype on your Mobile is easy. 
Here's some dead simple steps if you're using a Mac: 
Launch terminal
Drag your Ratchet project folder onto terminal (or cd to that directory)
Type "python -m SimpleHTTPServer" into terminal and hit return 
(should print something like "Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...")
Make sure your iPhone and Mac are on the same wireless connection
Get your Mac's IP address by opening System Preferences > Network and under Wi-Fi you'll see a given IP address
Enter your Mac's IP address followed by :8000 into Safari (i.e. 192.168.2.5:8000)
Voila! To make your Ratchet prototype look even better try adding it to your homescreen by clicking the share/plus button in Safari and selecting "Add to home screen". This will remove the browser chrome and make your app feel more native.
